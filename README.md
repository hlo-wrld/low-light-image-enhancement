# low-light-image-enhancement

The objective was to develop and evaluate an approach for enhancing images captured in low light. Two methods were implemented:
1.	Using Convolutional Neural Network
2.	Implementation of a research paper: LIME (Low-light Image Enhancement via Illumination Map Estimation)

**Evaluation**:
CNN Approach:
- PSNR:  27.871782500208866 
LIME Approach:
- PSNR:  28.458977457866048
