# low-light-image-enhancement

The objective was to develop and evaluate an approach for enhancing images captured in low light. Two methods were implemented:
1.	Using Convolutional Neural Network
2.	Implementation of a research paper: [LIME](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling/publication/LIME-tip.pdf) (Low-light Image Enhancement via Illumination Map Estimation)

**Evaluation**:
1. CNN Approach PSNR:  27.871782500208866
2. LIME Approach PSNR:  28.458977457866048
